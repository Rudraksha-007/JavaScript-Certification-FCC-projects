# JavaScript-Certification-FCC-projects
Welcome to the JavaScript Certification FCC Projects repository! 
This repository contains various projects that I have developed as part of my journey to learn and master JavaScript, including both foundational and advanced concepts. 

#Purpose 

This repository serves multiple purposes: 

Learning JavaScript: It is my playground for experimenting with JavaScript concepts, applying what I learn from the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) curriculum, and deepening my understanding of the language. 

Advanced Concepts: I aim to go beyond the basics by exploring advanced topics such as closures, asynchronous programming, ES6+ features, and design patterns. 

Project Showcase: This repository acts as a showcase of my progress and the projects I've built, reflecting my growing proficiency in JavaScript. 

#Projects 

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository: 

1.Palindrome Checker: This Project has a simple approach of taking a input string from the user and check if it's a palindrome in this project i learned about regex expressions, two pointer algorithm, event-listeners and some foundational topics of DOM 

#How I'm Using This Repository 

Iterative Learning: Each project is an opportunity to apply newly learned concepts and iterate on them to solidify my understanding. 

Code Reviews: I regularly review my code to identify areas for improvement and refactor when necessary. 

Documentation and Reflection: For each project, I document my thought process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented to reflect on my learning journey. 

Experimentation: I use this space to experiment with different JavaScript patterns and approaches to solve problems, fostering creativity and deeper learning. 

#Contributing
